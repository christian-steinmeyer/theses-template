% This template is based on 
% https://github.com/uniba-dsg/dsg-templates/tree/master/dsg-seminar-en
%
% But it was altered in several ways that aim at improving usability. 
% You can easily get started by defining variables such as the title of your 
% thesis etc. by changing them in "config/variables.tex".
%
% Chose whether you want the title page with one logo or with two logos in 
% "config/config.tex" by including the according file there. Default is one 
% logo.
%
% Images go in the "images" directory.
%
% Other resources, e.g. source code files, go in the "resources" directory.
%
% Simply start writing by adding sections in the "sections" directory and
% including these files below.
%
% Note, that this template is optimized for theses in computer science and Java 
% as main programming language. 
% 
% Feel free to configure listings, e.g. for other languages under 
% "config/listings.tex". Layout changes can be made in "config/layout.tex". Add
% packages to "config/packages.tex". Add new commands to "config/commands.tex".
